# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve ProtoForge.

## Ground Rules
- Prefer **adding** improvements over deleting features.
- Keep the anti-AI-design philosophy: dense, terminal-first, no rounded corners, no gradients.
- Add tests for bug fixes and new parsing/output behavior.

## Setup

```bash
git clone <your fork>
cd protoforge
npm install
```

## Running

```bash
npm start
```

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Pull Requests
- Keep PRs focused.
- Include a short description + screenshots (if TUI/web changes).
- Note which AI providers you tested (Ollama/OpenAI/etc.).
